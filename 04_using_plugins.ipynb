    "[FiftyOne Plugins](https://docs.voxel51.com/plugins/) are dynamic add-ons that allow users to customize and enhance the capabilities of FiftyOne by adding new features, easily installing, removing, or updating functionality without changing the core architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FiftyOne Plugin Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "FiftyOne provides a powerful plugin framework that empowers users to extend and customize functionality according to their specific needs. With plugins, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add new features to the FiftyOne App interface\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create seamless integrations with other tools and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Render custom panels for specialized data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add custom actions to menus for streamlined workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "* Execute long-running tasks on connected compute clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "The FiftyOne ecosystem includes numerous [ready-to-use plugins that address common computer vision workflows](https://docs.voxel51.com/plugins/#getting-started). For example, the [`@voxel51/io plugin`](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/io) enables data importing directly within the App, while the [`@voxel51/brain` plugin](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/brain) allows you to compute embeddings in the background while you continue working. Other popular plugins facilitate [model evaluation](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/evaluation), [annotation workflows](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/annotation), and [custom dashboards](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/dashboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of FiftyOne's built-in features are implemented as plugins, such as [interactive Panels](https://docs.voxel51.com/plugins/developing_plugins/#developing-panels) that function as miniature data applications within App Spaces, allowing you to explore geolocation data or visualize embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're using the growing collection of community plugins or developing your own, FiftyOne's plugin architecture provides a flexible foundation for customizing your computer vision workflows without compromising the stability of the core platform.\n"

    "[Delegated operations](https://beta-docs.voxel51.com/plugins/developing_plugins/#delegated-execution_1) allow you to schedule long-running tasks that execute in the background while you continue working with FiftyOne. \n",

    "### Why Use Delegated Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without [delegated operations](https://beta-docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.operators.delegated.DelegatedOperationService.html), tasks like computing embeddings would block your FiftyOne session until they complete. Delegated operations let you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Schedule tasks and continue working\n",
    "2. Run resource-intensive operations without affecting UI responsiveness\n",
    "3. Manage and track the status of long-running processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting a Delegated Service\n",
